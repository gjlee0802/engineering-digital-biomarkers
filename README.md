# Predicting glucose levels with data collected by non-invasive devices
This is a project to predict glucose by learning data collected by wearable devices.

With collected data from Accelerometer, Blood volume pulse, Electrodermal activity, Temperature, Interbeat interval, Heart rate, Food Log, interstitial glucose concentration, feature engineering is performed to utilize meaningful features for learning.
